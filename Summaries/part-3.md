After setting out seeking adventure towards Gandor in their luxurious yet strange
carriage they picked up for free. Elros, Regor and Kirito share the drive to meet
the wizard Gandalor. About 3/5 of their way into the journey they stop to help
a goblin who's being threatened by an Orc. Co-incidently they happened to do this
as a travelling Bard and Paladin duo, Davril Beerchaser the Half-Elf and Grog Waruk
the Half-Orc. Unhappy with how his kind treated the goblin Grog stepped up to the plate,
headbutted the Orc - breaking its nose before swifting ending the orcs life.

Upon discussing between themselves and the rescued goblin the newly formed party
decide they should help the goblin save the rest of his troop who's mining facility
has been taken over by orcs. These orcs have enslaved the goblins and are forcing
them to dig.

Reaching the fort a brief discussion is held with the orc at the gate before battle
ensues, fighting their way into the fort and through a large amount of the first area
the party rally up a small army of goblins to fight for them. One encounter included
a wolf which Grog managed to successfully tame and make his pet. The goblins inform
the party of hidden passages that the small goblins could exploit when attacking the
lower levels. In this dark maze of passages the heroes find a lake with a small island
and on the island they see a chest. After some slight persuasion Davril convinces
the goblins to swim across the lake and open the chest, successfully swimming across
but unable to open the heavy chest themselves.

After some looking the heroes notice some shadowy figures in the lake which didn't
seem to mind the goblins swimming across, as Elros makes the decision and starts
swimming himself Grog and Kirito decide to tie a rope to a spear in an attempt to
catch this strange creature. Enraged by the disturbance the creature swims up and
pulls Elros under with him as well as pulling on the spear which causes Grog to
fall in.

An underwater fight ensues, after being fed up of not doing anything Regor jumps
in to try and save Elros who is about to drown if not for some quick
thinking from Kirito. Using his magic dagger of returning he throws the dagger
into the water at the Merrow, which gets lodged in his gills and then returns
to the thrower. This dagger is slightly different however so brings the Merrow and
because he'd grappled Elros back to Kirito on the surface. Elros is almost crushed
by the Merrow and knocked unconcious by the huge beast. Within an inch of it's life
the Merrow looks to escape back to the water, but is halted by Davril who proceeds
to Viciously Mock the beast. After some quite nasty sneers "you slimey ****",
"why don't you go drown yourself" the Merrow is horrified and gives up trying,
and dies.

Meanwhile Grog is fighting the Merrows partner mermaid and viciously slices her
tail off and throws it to his pet wolf. Before bleeding out the paladin puts the
mermaid down and battle ends.

Whilst Grog is swimming out and tending to wolfs dinner. Regor is struggling to
get to the surface, who'd have known heavy armour wouldn't let you float... After
some further quick thinking the team throw the spear to Regor and pull him to safety.
Next task, find out what's in that chest... or go below...
