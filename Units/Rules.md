Ry's quick fire rules for fighting with an army (DISCLAIMER: PROVISIONAL AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE IF NEEDED)

- Each unit acts as a singular creature.
- Each commander (you) will roll initiative once and order all your units in one turn.
- No turn holding, you make your units moves your turn.
- Potential time limit on turns, you'll need to make all your move time is up.
- The units count decreases when the units health drops by a single unit count
  - eg, full Warrior Unit = 225 health, 14 Count Warrior Unit = 210 health
- Unit stops existing once it's health is 0.
- If a unit has to make a DC Save it's for the whole unit.
- Units move as one.
