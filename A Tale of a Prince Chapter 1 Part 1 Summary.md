Set in the small village of Cobblevale, about 100 miles away from the city of
Stonehaven. The heroes start off sitting at a table in the FatForker with each
other answerings a heroes call andintroducing themselves. During introductions
they are interrupted by a Barbarian bursting into the tavern exclaiming
the boy, his boy, had been taken.
He managed to catch one of the goblin culprits and in the process ripped
its leg off. After interrogating the one legged goblin the party finds
out the other goblins had taken what seems to be a simple farmers boy
to the tomb of the Legendary Knight of Argamar. When the goblin bleeds
out the Inn Keeper rushes out, blames the ruckus on the party and suggests
they save the boy as he is off great significance, he's a great decendent of
the legendary knight.
2 hours pass as the heroes follow the goblins path to the tomb and whilst in
the surrounding forest notice 3 goblins on "guard". An epic stealth javelin throw
from Elros Carter the Human Paladin pins of the goblins by the head to a wall.
One of the goblins escapes and the other has his head exploded by the warhammer
of Regor Bronzeshield the dwarf. The heroes hear further goblins in the distance
but prove no immediate threat.
Upon entering the tomb the heroes notice a path towards another corridor, but
the first room is an offerings and tribute room. In the center is a large
round table that appears solid at first, with a crazy awesome feat of strength
the Drow Rogue Kirito rips off half of the table top but inside there is only
a handful of ancient coins and a marble sword. Sensing significance in the sword
the Wood Elf Ranger Eltharion Elvewoodweavyl picks it up.
Onto the next corridor, with amazing stealth abilities Kirito, Elth and Elros
sneak down the corridor. Despite almost being left behind and noisily rushing
to catch up Regor sticks back with the team. A bloody battle ensues, Regor shows
off his healing power, and his ability to miss the enemy with his warhammer, whilst
Eltharion does support damage from a distance and Elros pulls out some spectacular
moves with healing from Regor and his god Bahamut. Unknown to all Kirito sneaks
round the battlefield eliminating goblins before dealing a nice blow to the Boss
Bugbear. Thanks to that distraction and several arrows from Elth, Elros is able to
deal the final blow to a fleeing prone Bugbear. Raising his sword up with the blade
pointing down he drove the blade through the Bugbears chest, pulling down and
effectively cutting the Bugbear in half. Eltharion catches and kills a fleeing
goblin and the heroes take the last goblin hostage.
Once the battle ends the team examine the room, a mural is on the walls that
depicts a young boy journey who grows to become the legendary Knight of Argamar.
The mural ends with a large marble statue stood in a heman pose but with no sword.
At the foot of this statue there is a quivering child hiding from the battle. The
heroes find out the boy thinks himself just a farmhand but the bugbear had tried
offering his blood to the statue in hopes of secret treasure. The puzzle is solved
when Elth puts the sword into the statues hand and it reacts by moving in a "knighting"
motion over Elths shoulders and opens a hidden door which Regor had previously
discovered and pointed out.
The new entrance is a narrow passage where over the years earth shifting has
caused chasms either side of the path which are too deep, the stairs walking
down are ancient and wooden and if not tread lightly will break. The heroes
decide to destroy the stairs and climb down, success all round apart from Regor,
who tried to show off by jump off whilst spinning and grabbing Elros' hand, but
missed and almost fell to his death into the chasm if not for some help/moral
support from Elth. The adventurers are all safely down with knowledge of an
undead being in the room ahead.
